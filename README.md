# Art
Hi there! This is a fun space where I play around with code to make art. In this repository, you'll find art projects that I've created using code. It's a mix of technology and art, and each project has its own little style and way of doing things. Feel free to take a look and see what's in here!

## Art Projects

### 1. Boxshadow Bulbasaur

**Overview**:  
The "Boxshadow Bulbasaur" is a pixel art representation of the popular Pok√©mon character, Bulbasaur. This project is all about using CSS box shadows to create a piece of art.

**How it's Made**:  
- **HTML Structure**: Just a single `div` is used as the canvas.
- **CSS Magic**: I used the `box-shadow` property a lot to place each "pixel" of the artwork.
- **Color Palette**: Colors are set up as CSS variables, so it's super easy to change things up if I want to.
